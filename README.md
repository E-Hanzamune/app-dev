### My Favorite Movie/Series

It would definitely have to be ~~Invincible by Robert Kirkman.~~ the Monogatari series by 'Nisio Isin'. It's an anime that tries to explain how common anime tropes are formed by manifesting each character's problems as some kind of God or *Oddity* as the show puts it. The anime has a lot of interesting perspective and philosophies, it also has one of the best animation that has come out from the anime industry with the movies(which came out 8 years ago) rivaling even the best anime movies of today, when it comes to the uniqueness of how the story is told, then Monogatari is one of the most unique ones, with the anime utilizing a lot of cinematography to tell stories or small details about characters that are very easy to miss.

TLDR: Monogatari has ~~good~~one of the best animation and artstyle, the story is hard to watch at first, but gets a lot better once it makes sense, and the way the story is told is incredibly unique
